# Front End Web Development Techdegree - Project 3

I am attempting to meet the "Exceeds Expectations" requirements for this project.  If my project doesn't meet the "Exceeds Expectations" requirements, please reject it as "needing additional work."

-  Project files placed in GitHub repository.

-  Project includes index.html:
  -  The HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document.
  -  A Google Font is being used.
  -  Only one <form> tag is being used to contain all the form elements.
  -  Fieldsets and legends have been added for "Contact Information" section and "Newsletter" section.
  -  Includes all of the required form fields: text input, email input, telephone input, select menu, checkboxes, radio buttons, textfield, submit button.
  -  Each form field includes the following attributes:  input has id, type, and name attributes; select and textarea includes id and name attributes.
  -  Each form field includes a label, and each labelâ€™s for attribute is associated with a unique id on its corresponding form field.
  -  The input field's placeholder attribute has been used to add the text "required" to the Full Name field and the Email address field.
  -  Form contains additional placeholder text for other text fields.
  -  Uses the required attribute to add HTML5 Validation for required fields.

-  Project contains a stylesheet (styles.css) inside of a CSS folder.
  -  A mobile-first approach is utilized using min-width properties for media queries (tablet and desktop screens at 768px.).
  -  General spacing and arrangement of the elements matches the design of the mockups for Mobile and Desktop.
  -  The label text position matches the mockups (above the form field for mobile, to the left side of the form field for desktop).
  -  Includes focus states for text fields.
  -  The following additional styling enhancements have been added to the portfolio: 1) change the background color for at least ONE of the main sections of the site, and 2) uses CSS transitions for focus states.

Validation:
  -  HTML validated for index.html with accepted exceptions.
  -  CSS validated for styles.css with accepted exceptions.
  -  I checked the pages in Opera, Chrome, and Firefox - everything appears to work.
